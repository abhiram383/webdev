Head one way, and you&#8217;ll hear Horseshoe Falls&#8217; crashing waters. In another direction, an indoor walkway leads to the more than 100 gaming tables and 3,000 slots at Fallsview Casino Resort. But you don\u2019t even have to leave the hotel to reach the Niagara Falls Fun Zone, which houses everything from Mini Putt Shipwreck Adventure to the Mystic Maze of Mirrors.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Casino package</strong>: You\u2019ll be treated to dining vouchers for Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steakhouse, DaGiorgio Italian Eatery, and IHOP as well as slot-play credit for Fallsview Casino or Casino Niagara and a tour of the Chocolate FX factory.</li>\n  <li><strong>Family package</strong>: You can dine at IHOP, East Side Mario&#8217;s Italian Eatery, and Outback Steakhouse, enjoy select attractions at the Niagara Falls Fun Zone and Captain Jack&#8217;s Fun Center, and tour the Chocolate FX factory.</li>\n  <li><strong>Live entertainment</strong>: Musical acts in all genres and large-scale magic acts take nearby stages.</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in the indoor heated pool or a jetted tub.</li>\n  <li><strong>Local shuttle service</strong> transports tourists to some of the most popular attractions in the Niagara Falls area for an additional fee.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Niagara Falls, Ontario: Panoramic Views of the Falls near Vegas-Style Casinos and Water Parks</h4>\n\n<p>At Niagara Falls, water thunders downward from a height of nearly 200 feet, crashing onto craggy boulders below. The falls straddle the border between Canada and the United States, but the Canadian side of the Niagara River is universally hailed as the finest vantage point to take in all three of Niagara Falls&#8217; photogenic brinks: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe Falls.</p>\n\n<p>Hornblower cruises ferry raincoat-clad passengers around the base of the falls from April to October, depending on the river&#8217;s ice conditions. Year-round, Journey Behind the Falls grants a glimpse behind the curtain of Horseshoe Falls\u2014visitors board an elevator that descends 150 feet into the bedrock, then stand at an observation deck steps from the cascading water. A 10-minute walk from the falls is the neon-lit Clifton Hill neighborhood. Its Fallsview Boulevard has plenty of Vegas-style kitsch, including glitzy casinos and indoor water parks.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8op6RduvX6YfDwnaX5xJ/mr-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-26T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-05T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-05T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"stcatharines-niagara","name":"St Catharines-Niagara","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":43.112,"lng":-79.166},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Niagara Falls, ON","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Hotel - Family - Outdoor","uuid":"bf1aaa5d-a9c9-4bd8-aa2d-e98ddfef2c69"},{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"four-points-by-sheraton-niagara-falls-fallsview","uuid":"b996d8a2-a51a-11e1-9a09-00259060afb4","name":"Four Points by Sheraton Niagara Falls Fallsview Hotel","websiteUrl":"http://www.fourpointsniagarafallsfallsview.com/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72709713,"uuid":"6d864b4c-4fac-427e-81cc-cee256867e7d","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-four-points-by-sheraton-niagara-falls-fallsview-39/confirmation?pledge_id=72709713","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 4-day cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

Or, weather permitting, guests can stay in and take in the stunning views of the city&#8217;s most famous buildings from the 22nd-floor Skyline Terrace.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Inn of Chicago</strong> is situated in the heart of downtown Chicago, only one-half block from the Magnificent Mile and many iconic Chicago attractions.</li>\n  <li><strong>A public transportation or cab ride away</strong> from Wrigley Field (5 miles), United Center (4.6 miles), and Soldier Field (3 miles)</li>\n  <li><strong>A pleasant walk to</strong> Navy Pier (1 mile), Millennium Park (1 mile), and Grant Park (1.5 miles); weather permitting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Chicago&#8217;s Magnificent Mile: Upscale Boutiques and Historic Architecture</h4>\n\n<p>On Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile, landmark skyscrapers such as the John Hancock Center and the Wrigley Building tower over the city&#8217;s liveliest retail corridor. In total, this stretch of high-end real estate houses some 460 stores, ranging from exclusive designers such as Armani and Chanel to beloved brands including Apple, American Girl, and Gap. Double-decker buses and horse-drawn carriages circle the Chicago Water Tower, a limestone icon that survived the Great Chicago Fire, and droves of shoppers navigate eight levels of boutiques and caf\u00E9s at the nearby Water Tower Place.</p>\n\n<p>Lake Shore Drive runs two blocks east of Michigan Avenue. <em>Travel + Leisure</em> calls this stretch \u201Cthe greatest architecture road on earth\u201D thanks to the superstar skyscrapers lined up along the lakefront. Looming above them all, of course, is the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower)\u2014the second-tallest building in the country.

It&#8217;s got plenty of green space: you can stroll through River Barn Park along the Milwaukee River or head to the Schlitz Audubon Nature Center along Lake Michigan. Here, there are 6 miles of trails in a 185-acre expanse of wilderness, and you can climb a 60-foot observation tower for panoramic views.</p>\n\n<p>Farther south is Milwaukee, a proud-and-unpretentious city with working-class roots. The town has been synonymous with brewing since the mid-1800s, when Miller, Pabst, and Schlitz dominated the landscape. Visit the Flemish-style Pabst Mansion, the 1890 estate of beer baron Frederick Pabst, and you&#8217;ll see just how profitable the beer business was. The mansion has 14 fireplaces, an opulent dining room, and several hidden compartments. Today there\u2019s a new microbrew-inspired scene. Lakefront Brewery on North Commerce Street has one of the city\u2019s best tours. Here, witty tour guides take guests through the beer-brewing process, encouraging them to enjoy samples of Lakefront\u2019s india pale ale and organic coffee stout along the way.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dbSWeBWMdDycnTDxUpVb/Pi-960x576/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-17T04:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-27T05:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-27T05:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"milwaukee","name":"Milwaukee","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":43.0389,"lng":-87.9065},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":true,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Mequon, WI","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Hotel - Romantic","uuid":"fa57eca2-1d23-4dc9-a981-3256fb3f1b90"},{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"sybaris-mequon","uuid":"a17c6c22-fbb1-cdd7-3e2d-812093ac1e0d","name":"Sybaris Pool Suites Mequon","websiteUrl":"https://www.sybaris.com/locations/mequon-wi/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72142911,"uuid":"37f76949-0362-44bf-8eda-5e2cfa118307","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-sybaris-pool-suites-mequon-15/confirmation?pledge_id=72142911","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Must book by 5/25/18 or promotional value expires.

You can find a taste of Old Vegas on Fremont Street, where vintage signs and showgirls crowned with headdresses recall the days of Sinatra and Martin. Beginning at dusk, a canopy of more than 12 million LED lights erupts in a psychedelic light-and-music show every hour. For an aerial view, zoom down the center of Fremont Street on a zipline.</p>\n\n<p>Nature puts on its own show at Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, a landscape of fiery-red sandstone formations and limestone cliffs just 17 miles outside the city.

Sybaris Pool Suites Indianapolis opened its doors in 1998 with 22 cottages, each outfitted with a jetted tub and most with a private pool heated to 92 degrees.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sybaris.com/suites/paradise-swimming-pool-suite/#Indianapolis\">Paradise pool suites</a></strong>: Each unit has a private 15-foot swimming pool with a soft-rain waterfall, jetted tub, misting steam room, decorative fireplace, and massage chair.</li>\n  <li><strong>Chocolate-covered strawberries</strong> make a perfect snack for a romantic evening. You&#8217;ll also get two souvenir champagne glasses.</li>\n  <li><strong>One-year Sybaris membership perks</strong>: You can make reservations at any Sybaris; you&#8217;ll also receive special discounts during your anniversary and birthday months.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Indianapolis: World-Class Museums and Sports Steeped in Midwestern Charm</h4>\n\n<p>Though it\u2019s known worldwide for the Indy 500 that takes place each May, Indianapolis offers much more than motorsports. A gorgeous esplanade known as the Canal Walk snakes through downtown, passing cultural institutions such as the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Nearby, the turn-of-the-century Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Monument marks the very center of the city with a nearly 285-foot-high limestone statue with an observation deck at the top. And farther north, the famed Children&#8217;s Museum of Indianapolis draws more than a million visitors per year.</p>\n\n<p>Indianapolis has also attracted a fair share of sports. The 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway allows rocket-shaped Indy cars to hit speeds upward of 230 mph and has a capacity of more than 250,000 spectators. Keep an eye out for a yard of bricks near the start/finish line, a leftover from the track\u2019s original surface in 1909. Basketball fans can watch the Indiana Pacers hit the court at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Nearby at Lucas Oil Stadium, you can watch the NFL\u2019s Indianapolis Colts.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/fAE6vGys9HWnEquswNSjg7iAa6o/fA-1732x1039/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-26T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-05T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-05T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"indianapolis","name":"Indianapolis","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":39.767,"lng":-86.1563},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":true,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Indianapolis, IN","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Hotel - Romantic","uuid":"fa57eca2-1d23-4dc9-a981-3256fb3f1b90"},{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"sybaris-indianapolis","uuid":"cdccec69-ea2e-71ea-727a-6449e40777f3","name":"Sybaris Pool Suites Indianapolis","websiteUrl":"https://www.sybaris.com/locations/indianapolis-in/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72144141,"uuid":"aba05644-2fd1-4660-9ec7-1a5db9310db4","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-sybaris-indianapolis-11/confirmation?pledge_id=72144141","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Must book by 6/4/18 or promotional value expires.

People from all over the world come here to enjoy the white-sand beaches, shop the high-end boutiques, and party at the legendary see-and-be-seen nightclubs the city is known for. The red-hot center of this sexy, international social scene is South Beach, a 20-block stretch filled with upscale lounges, rooftop bars, and ultrahip hangouts behind velvet ropes. Lummus Park beach is packed by mid-morning, and the clubs on Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue\u2014many of which stay open until 5 a.m.\u2014vie for the limelight with VIP service, celebrity DJs, and dressed-to-the-nines crowds.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the fast-paced luxury of South Beach lies Miami Beach\u2019s softer side. A leisurely stroll through the Art Deco District reveals hundreds of beautiful, candy-colored buildings, including Versace Mansion\u2014a 1930 manor modeled after a palace in the Dominican Republic that belonged to Christopher Columbus\u2019s family. The centerpiece of the city\u2019s arts scene, the Bass Museum of Art displays works from Peter Paul Rubens and Sandro Botticelli, and modern-design objects and propaganda arts fill three stories at the Wolfsonian-FIU museum. There\u2019s also a handful of vibrant ethnic enclaves to explore here, and Little Havana is among the most notable. The neighborhood is lined with family-owned restaurants and Caribbean-style marketplaces, making it a great place to discover some of the country\u2019s most delicious Cuban food, from sugary guarapo juice to pastelitos, or Cuban pastries.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3QSeTrC2SGJrNgUapeyg8Vo9n8Xy/3Q-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-05-09T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-29T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-29T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"miami","name":"Miami","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":25.7743,"lng":-80.1903},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Miami Beach, FL","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Hotel - City - Beach","uuid":"3f7e3707-566d-4036-8501-785e2b6263f8"},{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"3-star-top-secret-miami-beach-hotel-1","uuid":"34c9e473-9457-4e23-aea1-b24c5f3850c7","name":"3-Star Top-Secret Miami Beach Hotel","websiteUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72357887,"uuid":"f6871b71-caaf-48fc-bded-71aceb8c9fbd","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-top-secret-miami-beach-hotel-4/confirmation?pledge_id=72357887","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 48-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

It&#8217;s right across the street from America&#8217;s oldest state park and in front of the Rainbow Bridge, which links the American side of the falls to the Canadian side. Visitors can easily walk or drive across the bridge to visit Horseshoe Falls. It\u2019s also a block away from the Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino and a short drive from the Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls. All guest rooms have been renovated and boast wall-mounted flat-screen TVs, free WiFi, workstations, upgraded furniture, and amenity cabinets that house a refrigerator, microwave, and coffeemaker.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Get lucky</strong>: This deal comes with a  $15 free slot play with no coin-in required (one-time offer and must be a new member of the Social Club), $25 free slot play with $25 coin-in, or $25 match play for eligible table games at Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino (two per room).</li>\n  <li><strong>Best spot to see the falls on American soil</strong>: the observation tower in Niagara Falls State Park, which is a 10-minute walk from the hotel. </li>\n  <li><strong>Good for kids</strong>: There&#8217;s an indoor pool, and your stay includes a daily $10 arcade game card.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cheers!</strong>: This getaway comes with Niagara USA Wine Trail wine-tasting passes for two, valid at 19 different wineries around the region.

You can watch the water spill over jagged cliffs from pedestrian bridges and observation decks. The best view, though, might be from the Hurricane Deck, a wooden platform located 20 feet from Bridal Veil Falls. From spring to fall, you can access the platform by taking the Cave of the Winds tour, during which professional guides lead poncho-clad visitors to Bridal Veil Falls via wooden pathways. For an up-close encounter with the falls, you can book a ride aboard the <em>Maid of the Mist</em>; the tour boat shuttled sightseeing guests to the base of the thundering Horseshoe Falls for more than 100 years and continues to operate on the American side of the falls.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of tourists have flocked to Niagara Falls since the early 1800s. Around that time, Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s younger brother honeymooned in the area with his American bride; scores of newlyweds followed in their footsteps, earning Niagara Falls the nickname of \u201CHoneymoon Capital of the World.\u201D But it&#8217;s not just romantics that flock to the border town; it&#8217;s also a family-friendly destination, thanks to its indoor water parks, an aquarium, arcades, and casinos for the 21-and-older crowd. For outdoorsy types, the 400-acre Niagara Falls State Park offers miles of hiking trails.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2MzPfUPgECmwhwM4mikrRy3bATa6/2M-1500x900/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-17T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-20T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-20T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"buffalo","name":"Buffalo","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":42.8864,"lng":-78.8784},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Niagara Falls, NY","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Hotel - Family - Outdoor","uuid":"bf1aaa5d-a9c9-4bd8-aa2d-e98ddfef2c69"},{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"days-inn-at-the-falls","uuid":"61956204-935c-11e3-a4fb-00259060b07a","name":"Wyndham Garden at Niagara Falls","websiteUrl":"https://www.wyndhamgardenatniagarafalls.com/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72245027,"uuid":"2cd55db8-7ef3-47a6-8131-635399f90ded","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-wyndham-garden-at-niagara-falls/confirmation?pledge_id=72245027","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 48-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

In fact, the Dells area likely has more water slides per capita than any other spot on the planet.

The 100,000-square-foot casino, for example, has the feel of a masquerade ball. You can dine in restaurants that range from the casual All-American Bar and Grille to a voodoo-themed steak house that overlooks Las Vegas from the 50th floor.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Have a feast</strong> in one of the onsite restaurants.

Free parking makes traveling to and from the heart of the Big Easy a cinch. If it&#8217;s nature you want to explore, the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is just 20 minutes away. There, you can hike trails that wind through shady hardwood forests and mossy swamps.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: refrigerators, coffeemakers, high-definition TVs, and free WiFi</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep your routine</strong> and make a use of the on-site fitness center.</li>\n  <li><strong>Grab a beer and a slider</strong> at the on-site 100 Bar &amp; Grill.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dive in</strong> to the outdoor pool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>New Orleans\u2019s French Quarter: Let the Good Times Roll</h4>\n\n<p>&#8220;Stop thinking of New Orleans as the worst-organized city in the United States,&#8221; writes author Dan Baum in <em>Nine Lives</em>, his post-Katrina book. &#8220;Start thinking of it as the best-organized city in the Caribbean.&#8221; Some folks think there is something distinctly foreign about New Orleans, a place where people\u2019s priorities seem inclined toward enjoying life and relishing the moment at hand. Nothing says it better than the town\u2019s unofficial Cajun creed: \u201CLaissez les bons temp rouler,\u201D or &#8220;Let the good times roll.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Historical buildings with intricate wrought-iron balconies line the narrow streets of New Orleans\u2019s French Quarter. Here, street musicians often fill the air with jazz music, their trombones and tubas swinging back and forth. Just off the Jackson Square park and near the towering St. Louis Cathedral, the legendary Caf\u00E9 Du Monde serves beignets under heaping piles of powdered sugar. The nearby Frenchmen Street, just north of the Quarter, provides a slightly less touristy taste of New Orleans nightlife. Some of the city\u2019s most popular live jazz and blues bars dominate this historic two-block district, with each venue hosting world-class musicians nearly every night of the week. And then there&#8217;s Bourbon Street, where neon lights advertise frozen cocktails and crowds gather along 13 city blocks.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/22ri7Kr5knGePtBcgm4aVJzxoHSN/22-1500x900/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-20T04:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-02-27T06:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-02-27T06:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"new-orleans","name":"New Orleans","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":29.9546,"lng":-90.0751},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Gretna, LA","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel","uuid":"f6e06a1b-489c-456f-935f-76829b35622a"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"days-inn-gretna-new-orleans","uuid":"57cf31d7-d2e5-48d5-94de-0d3406b0423c","name":"Days Inn Gretna New Orleans","websiteUrl":"https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/days-inn/gretna-louisiana/days-inn-gretna-new-orleans-gretna/overview","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":71292919,"uuid":"10168215-0e42-41b7-87d1-b3e5d3784e1d","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-days-inn-gretna-new-orleans-4/confirmation?pledge_id=71292919","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 24-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

The couples-only resort, overlooking Lake Wallenpaupack\u2019s secluded shores, features a variety of romantically themed rooms for partners to share the perfect getaway.

The area has been a popular vacation destination ever since Pennsylvania Quakers opened a hotel here on the Delaware River in 1829. Today, the Poconos draw more than 25 million annual visitors, thanks to year-round recreational opportunities and stunning natural scenery.</p>\n\n<p>The warmer months are a great time to explore the region\u2019s lakes and wooded hills. For spectacular hikes, check out Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, where you can trek to dramatic waterfalls or follow a 27-mile section of the historic Appalachian Trail. A handful of little towns full of antique shops and galleries nestle in the mountains, too. You&#8217;ll find boutique wine galleries and historical mansions tucked away on country roads, including the late 19th-century Asa Packer Mansion, which is open for tours, in the borough of Jim Thorpe.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/nNTqXY1zfLLoZ2nGCN6yptbdLRZ/nN-1375x825/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-23T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-20T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-20T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"philadelphia","name":"Philadelphia","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":39.9516,"lng":-75.1638},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Lakeville, PA","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel - Romantic - Outdoor","uuid":"2db1b44c-edba-46cb-865f-b9190399ba0a"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"cove-haven-resort","uuid":"d3a71020-1484-11e2-bd2c-002590922bea","name":"Cove Haven Resort","websiteUrl":"https://www.covepoconoresorts.com/our-resorts/cove-haven-lakeville-pa/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72190393,"uuid":"71c9a304-dfae-4604-8256-6f2ac0164e53","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-cove-haven-resort-49/confirmation?pledge_id=72190393","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 6-day cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

The little resort overlooking the Caribbean Sea grew from a single bar and a bungalow into a major stop-off point for travelers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: Each standard and superior room is airy and cool, and overlooking a lush garden from a private balcony or patio. </li>\n  <li><strong>Start your day right</strong> with a complimentary breakfast for two, included with this voucher. </li>\n  <li><strong>Never miss a meal</strong> thanks to the onsite restaurant, which serves up Jamaican and international fare. </li>\n  <li><strong>Stay in shape</strong> after all that delicious food with two complimentary passes to the onsite gym per day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Beachfront activities</strong> range from huge bonfires by the beach to water-front karaoke.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Negril, Jamaica: Laid-Back Beach Town with Picturesque Sunsets, Snorkeling, and Cliff Diving</h4>\n\n<p>Located on Jamaica\u2019s western coast, Negril is known for its white-sand beaches, dramatic rugged cliffs, and coral reefs lying just offshore in the Caribbean. Its underwater beauty makes the town a popular spot for scuba diving and snorkeling at Negril Marine Park, and anglers have found the sea filled with blue marlin, wahoo, and mahi-mahi. The city has a front-row seat to some of the world\u2019s most beautiful sunsets, and people often climb to the top of waterfront cliffs just to watch. At Rick\u2019s Cafe, which is listed in the book <em>1,000 Places To See Before You Die</em>, groups congregate every night to watch the sun dip below the horizon; some brave adventurers even leap off the 35-foot cliffs into the water.</p>\n\n<p>Often called &#8220;the capital of casual,&#8221; Negril is best defined by its laid-back vibe, from the slow and steady rhythm of the indigenous reggae music to its unofficial uniform\u2014swimsuits and flip-flops. Running along the town is Seven Mile Beach, a stretch of powdery, white-sand coastline that earned a spot on <em>Frommer\u2019s</em> Best Beaches in the Caribbean list. The town center comprises a shopping mall and a craft market where visitors can pick up locally produced goods.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Visitors can still view the town founder&#8217;s original home, the Alexandre Mouton House, and admire its authentic period furnishings.

As you walk around town, you\u2019re likely to spot a zydeco band or two churning out tunes on accordions, guitars, and wearable percussion instruments known as vest froittoirs.

If you&#8217;re in town for pleasure, the Galleria Dallas shopping center is less than 10 minutes away, while downtown is a quick trip south.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Spacious accommodations</strong>: Comfy guest rooms have flat-screen TVs, microwaves, and mini fridges.</li>\n  <li><strong>Start the day right</strong> with a complimentary breakfast buffet.</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in the outdoor pool and jetted tub.</li>\n  <li><strong>Break a sweat</strong> in the fitness center.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Dallas, Texas: Rejuvenated Urban Districts and Historical Parks</h4>\n\n<p>Though some know Dallas only for the massive AT&amp;T Stadium (which is actually in Arlington), the city is also an enclave of arts and nature, overflowing with botanical gardens, art galleries, and live theater. Historic Main Street connects many of the city\u2019s recently rejuvenated urban districts, as well as the popular Main Street Garden, a block-long public park surrounded by architecturally significant buildings. </p>\n\n<p>A short walk from downtown Dallas, you\u2019ll find horse-drawn carriages clopping along brick streets in the city&#8217;s historic West End district, which dates back to the 19th century. This part of the city also contains Dealey Plaza, where President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. At The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, you can visit the spot where Lee Harvey Oswald is believed to have shot at Kennedy\u2019s presidential motorcade.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/7uSeCZbHha8uk8ppR1oD/Xh-960x582/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-05-02T04:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-10T05:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-10T05:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"dallas","name":"Dallas","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":32.7811,"lng":-96.7971},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Dallas, TX","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel - City","uuid":"6fad7592-26a3-4fa7-a341-c2f13b40e601"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true},{"name":"hideCalendarOnLoggedOut","enabled":true},{"name":"hidePriceOnLoggedOut","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"holiday-inn-express-suites-dallas-park-central","uuid":"3ff129b2-af7c-11e3-9891-00259060b07a","name":"Holiday Inn Express & Suites Dallas Park Central Northeast","websiteUrl":"https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/dallas/dalvp/hoteldetail","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72531955,"uuid":"0e8d7748-7f9f-45c7-ab5d-e3985d657115","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-holiday-inn-express-suites-dallas-park-central-northeast-5/confirmation?pledge_id=72531955","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 24-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

A number of natural attractions are also nearby. Just 1 mile from the hotel, visitors can see\u00A057 acres of wetlands and forests at Bivens Arm Nature Park. While strolling along its nature trail or boardwalk, they may spot several types of herons and egrets.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Cool off</strong> in the outdoor pool, then relax on a lounger in the shade.</li>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: All rooms feature microwaves, flat-screen TVs, mini fridges, and balconies. </li>\n  <li><strong>Lakeside Bar &amp; Grill</strong>: Enjoy breakfast or dinner in the on-site restaurant&#8217;s dining room or on its waterfront terrace.</li>\n  <li><strong>Work out</strong> in the hotel&#8217;s fitness center. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Gainesville, Florida: World-Class Museums, Historical College Buildings, and Legendary Sports Facilities</h4>\n\n<p>Located in northern Florida, Gainesville conveniently sits in the middle of several Florida destinations: Orlando, St. Augustine, Tampa, and Jacksonville are all within a two-hour drive. Livability.com named it the number one college town in 2010, calling it \u201Ca sports fan&#8217;s paradise&#8221; because of the community&#8217;s fervent love for the University of Florida&#8217;s football team. You can&#8217;t avoid the Gator logo here\u2014it&#8217;s brandished on store windows, car bumpers, and sportswear all over town. A visit to the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, affectionately known as &#8220;The Swamp,&#8221; reaffirms the hype as more than 90,000 rowdy, orange-and-blue-clad spectators fill the stands. But the highlight of any match comes when the band breaks into the <em>Jaws</em> theme song and fans collectively raise their arms for an intimidating Gator Chomp.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the action in Gainesville centers on the campus, which lies about 2 miles from downtown Gainesville and is known for its cluster of historic buildings. Century Tower, a more-than-150-foot-tall Gothic carillon, stands out both for its height and frequent clanging of the &#8220;Florida Chimes&#8221; bell tune. On the campus\u2019s western edge, the Florida Museum of Natural History tells the state&#8217;s history with more than 500 fossils and Native American artifacts. While you\u2019re there, take a stroll through the museum&#8217;s Butterfly Rainforest, where hundreds of butterfly species from around the world live among lush, tropical trees and cascading waterfalls.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3cCmSCpvkmTeBmXtjTUxMAW2Nk5Q/3c-900x540/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-05-01T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-01T05:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-01T05:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"gainesville","name":"Gainesville","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":29.6516,"lng":-82.3248},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Gainesville, FL","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel","uuid":"f6e06a1b-489c-456f-935f-76829b35622a"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"wyndham-garden-gainesville","uuid":"6c003efc-a23d-4fc8-b25f-e4f27837beed","name":"Wyndham Garden Gainesville","websiteUrl":"https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham-garden/gainesville-florida/wyndham-paramountplaza-gainesville/overview","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":71404479,"uuid":"4b65ec7a-41a6-444e-b8b1-95a4b2d08c8e","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-wyndham-garden-gainesville-3/confirmation?pledge_id=71404479","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 24-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

Originally built in 1870 to keep sand out of hotel lobbies, the boardwalk grew in popularity as a place where you could drink and gamble during Prohibition without much trouble from the police, as depicted in HBO&#8217;s <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>. The boardwalk is still popular for its casinos, but it&#8217;s family-friendly, too; visitors are just as inclined to sit at the beach or stop at one of the many carnival rides.</p>\n\n<p>On the boardwalk, it&#8217;s worth it to check out the Absecon Lighthouse, which is more than 150 years old.

The hotel&#8217;s choice location puts guests just minutes from the beach and shopping destinations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Glitzy history</strong>: Built in 1929, The Claridge Hotel has hosted such celebrities as Marilyn Monroe, Al Capone, and Frank Sinatra. It&#8217;s one of the oldest remaining skyscrapers from Atlantic City&#8217;s early boom, and channels the Roaring Twenties feel popularized by the TV show <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: Recently renovated <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1RtjRRq\">guest rooms</a> feature complimentary WiFi and Keurig coffeemakers. Book the jetted-tub king room to enjoy the added perks of a jetted tub and two welcome drinks at VUE Rooftop Bar.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hit the jackpot</strong> at Bally&#8217;s Casino, directly accessible from the hotel.</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in the indoor pool.</li>\n  <li><strong>Break a sweat</strong> in the fitness center.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Atlantic City, New Jersey: Casinos and Carnival Rides Lining Historical Beachside Boardwalk</h4>\n\n<p>No trip to Atlantic City is complete without a stroll along its signature boardwalk, which stretches for 6 miles along New Jersey&#8217;s eastern coast. Originally built in 1870 to keep sand out of hotel lobbies, the boardwalk grew in popularity as a place where you could drink and gamble during Prohibition without much trouble from the police, as depicted in HBO&#8217;s <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>. The boardwalk is still popular for its casinos, but it&#8217;s family-friendly, too; visitors are just as inclined to sit at the beach or stop at one of the many carnival rides.</p>\n\n<p>On the boardwalk, it&#8217;s worth it to check out the Absecon Lighthouse, which is more than 150 years old.

Splashy rides such as River Canyon Run\u2014a four-story raft water slide\u2014and a zero-depth-entry wave pool with 3-foot swells surround the park&#8217;s iconic hub: a four-story treehouse with a 1,000-gallon tipping bucket. Younger kids will have a blast with the gentle spray features of Cub Paw Pool.</p>\n\n<p>The water park, which hovers around 84 degrees all year long, isn&#8217;t the resort&#8217;s only family-friendly activity.

People from all over the world come here to enjoy the white-sand beaches, shop the high-end boutiques, and party at the legendary see-and-be-seen nightclubs the city is known for. The red-hot center of this sexy, international social scene is South Beach, a 20-block stretch filled with upscale lounges, rooftop bars, and ultrahip hangouts behind velvet ropes. Lummus Park beach is packed by mid-morning, and the clubs on Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue\u2014many of which stay open until 5 a.m.\u2014vie for the limelight with VIP service, celebrity DJs, and dressed-to-the-nines crowds.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the fast-paced luxury of South Beach lies Miami Beach\u2019s softer side. A leisurely stroll through the Art Deco District reveals hundreds of beautiful, candy-colored buildings, including Versace Mansion\u2014a 1930 manor modeled after a palace in the Dominican Republic that belonged to Christopher Columbus\u2019s family. The centerpiece of the city\u2019s arts scene, the Bass Museum of Art displays works from Peter Paul Rubens and Sandro Botticelli, and modern-design objects and propaganda arts fill three stories at the Wolfsonian-FIU museum. There\u2019s also a handful of vibrant ethnic enclaves to explore here, and Little Havana is among the most notable. The neighborhood is lined with family-owned restaurants and Caribbean-style marketplaces, making it a great place to discover some of the country\u2019s most delicious Cuban food, from sugary guarapo juice to pastelitos, or Cuban pastries.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/35SwjVrRojcBMqLxjBGdy9Nh1jYR/35-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-05-04T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-12T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-12T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"miami","name":"Miami","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":25.7743,"lng":-80.1903},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Bay Harbor Islands, FL","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel","uuid":"f6e06a1b-489c-456f-935f-76829b35622a"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"tryp-by-wyndham-miami-bay-harbor","uuid":"93d16ca6-cb8f-4c6d-869e-650935caddef","name":"TRYP by Wyndham Miami Bay Harbor","websiteUrl":"http://www.trypmiamibayharbor.com/","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":73070749,"uuid":"4483bcab-d135-4c7f-8215-052af6965e0e","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-tryp-by-wyndham-miami-bay-harbor/confirmation?pledge_id=73070749","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 72-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

The city&#8217;s galleries and museums are just a 20-minute drive away.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: mini fridges and free WiFi</li>\n  <li><strong>Best way to start the day</strong>: with a free continental breakfast that includes pastries, cereals, and fruits</li>\n  <li><strong>Where to unwind</strong>: the indoor heated pool and jetted tub, which are open no matter the weather</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Downtown Minneapolis: Thriving Performing-Arts Scene near Idyllic Lakes</h4>\n\n<p>Downtown Minneapolis is more than just the geographic epicenter of the city\u2014it\u2019s the cultural heart too. Sports venues home to the Timberwolves, Vikings, and Twins neighbor the lively nightclubs of the Warehouse District and the neon-lit marquees of the Hennepin Theater District. In recent years, the city\u2019s arts scene has gotten a lot of attention, and for good reason: Minneapolis has more live theater shows per capita than any other US city except New York. Additionally, dozens of eclectic galleries complement the wide-ranging exhibits at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, which showcases everything from Japanese woodcut prints to turn-of-the-century European advertisements.</p>\n\n<p>To navigate downtown with ease, step into the Skyway, the city\u2019s ingenious solution to harsh Minnesota winters. The Skyway is a network of indoor, aboveground tunnels connecting a slew of buildings downtown. A popular stop along the way is Nicollet Mall, a shopping thoroughfare where cars are not allowed. This is where you\u2019ll find the iconic statue of Mary Tyler Moore tossing her 10-gallon Stetson into the air.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/2qazEtjCf4GgU6rqFgizgLS2Y5Gz/2q-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-27T04:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-05T05:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-05T05:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"minneapolis-stpaul","name":"Minneapolis / St Paul","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":44.98,"lng":-93.2638},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Bloomington, MN","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel","uuid":"f6e06a1b-489c-456f-935f-76829b35622a"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"guesthouse-inn-and-suites-bloomington","uuid":"d24d8bca-e319-4361-9c3a-602c801f94cd","name":"GuestHouse Inn Bloomington","websiteUrl":"https://www.redlion.com/gh-bloomington","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72711835,"uuid":"649921ef-4872-4796-9e14-aa0676782993","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-guesthouse-inn-bloomington-2/confirmation?pledge_id=72711835","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 72-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

This hotel puts you within 40 miles of the national park and just 10 miles from downtown Knoxville, where you can dive into the town&#8217;s bluegrass scene, try its famous biscuits, and visit the iconic Sunsphere.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: Spacious guest rooms feature free WiFi and beds swathed in signature Dream Well bedding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Most important meal of the day</strong>: The hotel&#8217;s complimentary breakfast spread includes fresh muffins and pastries, fresh fruit, cereal, toasts, waffles, coffee, and tea.</li>\n  <li><strong>Many restaurants and shops</strong> are within walking distance of the hotel.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stuff to do</strong>: Catch a show at the Clarence Brown Theatre or lock eyes with a western lowland gorilla at the Knoxville Zoo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Knoxville, Tennessee: College Town near the Great Smoky Mountains</h4>\n\n<p>The Tennessee River cuts right through the middle of Knoxville, and along its banks lies one of the cornerstones of the city: the University of Tennessee campus. The university\u2019s football team, the Tennessee Volunteers (or \u201CVols\u201D), has won six national championships since their first season in 1891. They play right on campus in Neyland Stadium, a beast of a venue that can hold more than 100,000 fans. Not to be outdone, the women&#8217;s basketball team has won eight national championships and are a perennial powerhouse. It&#8217;s largely thanks to the Lady Vols&#8217; success that Knoxville was chosen as the site for the Women&#8217;s Basketball Hall of Fame.</p>\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s more to Knoxville than its fabled athletic programs. In 1982, it hosted the World\u2019s Fair, which produced perhaps the city\u2019s most recognizable landmark: the Sunsphere, a giant, shimmering golden ball on top of a tower. From World\u2019s Fair Park downtown, you can walk to Market Square, which features boutiques, restaurants, and a seasonal farmers&#8217; market. A few blocks away, the opulent Tennessee Theatre hosts musical acts, touring Broadway shows, and classic films.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/epTA2pdaBZ7duoywQVyU/81-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-05-04T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-04-12T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-04-12T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"knoxville","name":"Knoxville","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":35.9606,"lng":-83.9207},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Knoxville, TN","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel - Outdoor","uuid":"a8d77b1f-d142-4621-871e-880eadf6d6b4"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"microtel-inn-suites-by-wyndham-knoxville","uuid":"be9f7113-73c5-1842-8587-5b68ccd078a3","name":"Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Knoxville","websiteUrl":"https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/microtel/knoxville-tennessee/microtel-inn-knoxville/overview","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":72243245,"uuid":"a3e161d5-8563-497c-b720-3412c2677106","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-microtel-inn-suites-by-wyndham-knoxville-28/confirmation?pledge_id=72243245","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased. 24-hour cancellation notice required prior to check-in or reservation is non-refundable; reservations made within cancellation window are non-refundable.

The city was named one of the best vacation spots in the United States for a family by <em>USA Today</em>, in part because of its wooden boardwalk, which stretches for more than a mile and buzzes with carnival games and amusement-park rides. Hop into the SkyWheel Ferris wheel\u2019s gondolas, surrounded by more than a million LED lights, for a panoramic view of the city below.</p>\n\n<p>Less than 20 miles south of Myrtle Beach, the tiny fishing village of Murrells Inlet provides a tranquil contrast to the boardwalk&#8217;s hustle and bustle. At Brookgreen Gardens, more than 2,000 sculptures stand amid sprawling floral gardens and massive, moss-covered oak trees that have been around for centuries. Murrells Inlet is also home to the Tom Fazio\u2013designed TPC Myrtle Beach golf course, 1 of nearly 100 courses in the area that helped Myrtle Beach earn its title as the seaside golf capital of the world.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3ukeR79sGJw8AUswc3GGNzyaXtbG/3u-960x576/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2018-04-20T03:59:59Z","startAt":"2018-03-15T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2018-03-15T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"getaways","name":"Getaways"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"charleston","name":"Charleston","timezone":"Eastern Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","lat":32.7766,"lng":-79.9309},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":true,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"Myrtle Beach, SC","locationNote":"<a href=\"http://gr.pn/getawaysfaq\"><b>Groupon Getaways FAQ</b></a>","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Accommodation type","uuid":"99454e6e-5451-4cba-99b4-dd59b30f3295"},{"name":"Hotel - Family - Beach","uuid":"dc3169d6-7bc3-49dc-8e2e-15e1d8c4d96d"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"getaways"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"merchant":{"id":"ocean-park-resort","uuid":"ed8bccfe-3feb-11e3-8fa1-00259096a2fc","name":"Ocean Park Resort","websiteUrl":"http://oceanparkresort.com","facebookUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":71916761,"uuid":"75367c06-a412-46b1-ba06-998059544b26","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-ocean-park-resort-1/confirmation?pledge_id=71916761","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Dates cannot be changed once booked; valid only for night(s) purchased.
